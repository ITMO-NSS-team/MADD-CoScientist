    Generation of molecules for the treatment of dyslipidemia.
    Dyslipidemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by abnormally high or low amounts of any or all lipids (e.g. fats, triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids) or lipoproteins in the blood.[1] Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases,[1] which include coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease.[1] Although dyslipidemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, abnormal levels do not mean that lipid lowering agents need to be started.
    Molecules that inhibit Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 with enhanced bioavailability and \
    the ability to cross the BBB. Molecules have affinity to the protein ATP citrate synthase, enhances reverse cholesterol transport via ABCA1 upregulation\
    , inhibits HMG-CoA reductase with improved safety profile compared to statins. It can be  PCSK9 inhibitors to enhance LDL receptor recycling and reduce LDL cholesterol levels.\
    Hot keys: molecules that disrupt the interaction between CD36 and oxidized LDL; ligands for SREBP-1c \
    inhibition to regulate fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis; dual-action agents that modulate both HDL \
    and LDL for improved cardiovascular outcomes; AMPK pathway to promote fatty acid oxidation;\
    IC50 value lower than 50 µM for inhibiting CETP;  Tmax of less than 2 hours for rapid action in lipid regulation;\
    a negative logD at pH 7.4 for improved selectivity in tissues; ANGPTL3 inhibitor to reduce plasma triglycerides;\
    PPARα agonist with reduced side;  ApoC-III antisense oligonucleotide with enhanced cellular uptake.
