    Generation of molecules for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
    Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease resulting in damage to the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.[3] As a demyelinating disease, MS disrupts the nervous system's ability to transmit signals, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems.[1][8][9] Symptoms include double vision, vision loss, eye pain, muscle weakness, and loss of sensation or coordination.[3][10][11] MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms).[12][13] In relapsing forms of MS symptoms may disappear completely between attacks, although some permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.[13] In progressive forms of MS, bodily function slowly deteriorates once symptoms manifest and will steadily worsen if left untreated.[14]
    There are high activity tyrosine-protein kinase BTK inhibitors or highly potent non-covalent \
    BTK tyrosine kinase inhibitors from the TEC family of tyrosine kinases that have the potential \
    to affect B cells as a therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.\
    Hot keys: high activity tyrosine-protein kinase BTK inhibitors;  inhibit Bruton's tyrosine kinase \
    through non-covalent interaction; non-covalent BTK inhibitors with enhanced permeability across the blood-brain \
    barrier and high selectivity for Cytoplasmic tyrosine-protein kinase BMX;  immune signaling pathways \
    to treat multiple sclerosis.
